# Project changelog

## 2026-07-21 — M003: PIT Fintech proposal HTML deck

- Added a four-slide, self-contained HTML presentation under `docs/reports/`.
- Covers project goal, failure modes, end-to-end architecture/technology, and output direction.
- Positions the project primarily as Fintech/MLOps engineering with research-backed evidence;
  Jupyter/cloud experimentation remains an enabler rather than the outcome.
- Added keyboard navigation, fullscreen mode, responsive 16:9 layout, and print styling.
- Verified all four slides at 1440x810 with no content overflow or console warnings/errors;
  button and keyboard navigation pass.
- Regression evidence: 23 pytest cases and Ruff checks pass.
- Detail: [M003 log](milestones/M003-proposal-html-deck.md).

## 2026-07-21 — M002: Milestone audit governance and documentation layout

- Added mandatory milestone logging rules to `AGENTS.md`.
- Added a pre-commit guard requiring project status, cumulative changelog, and a detailed
  milestone log for staged implementation changes.
- Made `artifacts/changelog/` a tracked exception while preserving gitignore for runtime runs.
- Moved human-readable reports to `docs/reports/` and feature-store guides to
  `docs/feature-store/`.
- Evidence: four hook unit cases, 23 passing tests, Ruff, and installed `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
- Detail: [M002 log](milestones/M002-milestone-audit-governance.md).

## 2026-07-21 — M001: Sprint 1 foundation and temporal correctness slice

- Established Make/PowerShell/CLI/CI control plane and locked Python environment.
- Added synthetic temporal oracle, 13 feature specs, temporal/unit tests, and three notebooks.
- Added versioned Bronze/Silver Delta sample with label separation and time-travel evidence.
- Verified 0 future reads and deterministic logical checksums on the sample path.
- Sprint 1 remains in progress because application-data EDA, entity decision, and model
  baselines are pending.
- Detail: [M001 log](milestones/M001-sprint-1-foundation.md).
